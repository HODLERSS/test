        <h3>Price Forecasting</h3>
        <p>I forecast Bitcoin price and mining economics at MARA, collaborating closely with the Finance team. I lead weekly discussions on Bitcoin price and hashprice trends, covering macroeconomic factors and stock markets to provide actionable insights for our management.</p>

        <h3>M&A</h3>
        <p>I led three data center acquisitions for MARA, totaling 590MW with a purchase price of ~$260 million. I led due diligence across teams, evaluated opportunities, provided recommendations to management, and negotiated with counterparties. These acquisitions are now key to our cash flow.</p>

        <h3>Venture Capital</h3>
        <p>I am working for MARA's venture investments, focusing on developing our investment thesis, writing investment memos, and supporting decision-making with the management team. My first deal was leading a $2 million investment in Anadro as part of a $3 million seed round.</p>

        <h3>Blockchain & Web3</h3>
        <p>I was an early member of Ground X, building Klaytn, a layer-1 blockchain platform launched in 2019. I led a team of 10+ engineers, developed the developer ecosystem, and launched products including Klip wallet, Klaytn API service, and an NFT marketplace, with over a million active users.</p>

        <h3>Data Science</h3>
        <p>My career began as a data scientist at TMON, one of Korea's leading e-commerce platforms, where I developed a product recommendation engine and pricing algorithm. Currently, I advise MARA's data science team in building OptiMine for optimizing our Bitcoin mining operations.</p>

        <h3>LLM</h3>
        <p>I believe LLM is the most innovative technology since the computer and the internet. It will continue to transform how we work. I built several MARA LLM agents for market intelligence and strategy research, which have improved our team's productivity and work quality by at least 10x.</p>
