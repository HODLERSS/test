      <h3>Price Forecasting</h3>
      <p>Forecasting the price of Bitcoin—or any market asset—with precision is an impossible task. I often say, “If I could predict it accurately most of the time, I would already be a billionaire.” Even though I am responsible for forecasting Bitcoin prices and mining economics at MARA, I consistently remind our management and colleagues of the inherent challenges. Does this sound irresponsible? Allow me to explain my perspective.</p>
      <p>While acknowledging the difficulty, it’s crucial to recognize the importance of forecasting Bitcoin prices. For companies like MARA, which operate Bitcoin mining businesses and hold a substantial amount of Bitcoin (over 27,000 BTC, approximately $1.6 billion as of this writing), regularly updating our price forecasts—at least monthly—is necessary. But why forecast if the predictions are likely to be inaccurate?
      <p>Our revenue primarily comes from Bitcoin mining, and our significant Bitcoin holdings impact our balance sheet. Understanding daily, weekly, and monthly price movements, along with shifting market sentiments, is essential. Even if we don’t act on daily price fluctuations, staying attuned to market trends and key metrics allows us to revisit our HODL strategy, Bitcoin acquisition plans, or investment decisions in mining infrastructure. By closely monitoring Bitcoin’s performance, we ensure our decisions are informed rather than reactive.

      <h3>M&A</h3>
      <p>I led a due diligence team at MARA for the acquisition of three data centers totaling 580 MW. I organized internal due diligence calls and directed the evaluation process. Successfully closing these acquisitions, they now serve as primary assets generating cash flow for MARA.</p>
      <p>The first two acquisitions involved data centers from Generate Capital, a private equity firm. The third was from Applied Digital, a public company. Through this experience, I learned how to form and lead internal teams for acquisitions, negotiate effectively with counterparties, and achieve optimal outcomes.

    <div id="venture-investment" class="project-details">
      <h3>Venture Investment</h3>
      <p>I had the privilege of leading MARA’s first investment round, contributing $2 million to a $3 million seed round for Anadro. Anadro builds overprovisioned solar facilities equipped with batteries and Bitcoin miners. They offer power to customers at a 25% discount compared to traditional utilities and use excess energy for Bitcoin mining.
</p>
      <p>We invested in Anadro because it exemplifies an ideal use case for Bitcoin mining. The interruptible nature of Bitcoin mining makes it perfect for balancing renewable energy supply, which can be volatile. By utilizing excess energy, Anadro enhances the profitability of renewable assets, benefiting both the environment and the economy.

      <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains</p>
