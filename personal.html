        <h3>Hockey</h3>
        <p>I love playing hockey. I was an all-star player during my time at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, playing as an offensive player and consistently scoring in nearly every game. Playing hockey keeps me energized and engaged, positively impacting my life.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I was a professional wedding singer and street performer. I love singing, playing guitar, and creating original songs. I enjoy jazz, pop, and K-pop. I even won a Karaoke Night championship at the Tuck School of Business. Music is a way for me to express creativity and relax.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I have a strong passion for coding, which allows me to experiment with new technologies (focused on LLM recently), automate tasks, and solve complex problems. Programming is both a professional skill and a personal interest that keeps me engaged and constantly learning.</p>
